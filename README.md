### About the App

Below you will see a link to my deployed application. Upon clicking the link, you will be sent to the single page application. If you have not signed up, please do so first. **Please note that this is not a secure application, and you should not be using real email and passwords for sign in and sign up**. Once you have signed in, you will see a game board. Click New Game before making a move so the page can register a new game. Once you have clicked new game, play freely! You will be notified of a tie, a win for X, or a win for O. Once the game result has been determined, feel free to start a new game or sign out. 

If you sign out in the middle of a game, you will lose the progress on that game.
